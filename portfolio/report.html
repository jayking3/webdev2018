Jay King <br> <br>
Introduction:	What	is	the	essential	story	being	told	by	your	site	and	what	type	of	structure
did	you	choose	to	implement. <br>
The story that I chose for my website was my personal portfolio, this will just allow me to have something if I ever want to have my own personal website. I believe that I will continue to develop my website after I have submitted this website. The structure that I wished to implement was a one whole page type which would allow me to keep all of my content within one place. <br> <br>
State 3	things	that	have	inspired	you	when	creating	your	website. These	could	include
guest	speakers,	other	websites,	artists,	developers	etc. <br>
My design of my website hasn't really been inspired by certain websites that I have seen, more like a compilation of what I like within all present websites. <br> <br>
State	3	ways	in	which	your	site	is	accessible. <br>
I have only one feature that has made my site more accessible, this is the button in the bottom right portion of the site that allows the user to click it then go straight back up to the top of the webpage. <br> Another that is kind of an accessibility feature is that when the user is attempting to load the site on a mobile device, then they will always have the nav bar on the top of the browser, and all of the content has been proportioned to their device. <br> <br>

State	3	ways	in	which	you	have	considered	usability	in	your	site. <br>
One thing, using CSS, I have made everything proportioned to specific devices, there are two modes that are described as mobile and desktop. Desktop is the normal version, mobile is a more compressed version that just compresses the information into the device's viewport. <br>
I have also included a feature that includes my Twitch livestream and chat that are realtime, so that when I start streaming on Twitch, people, whoever they are, will be able to watch in on my website, be the content games or programming.<br> <br>

State	3	things	you	had	to	learn/find	out	by	yourself	when	creating	your	site,	and	describe
how	you	did	that (i.e.	what	searches	you	did,	any	new	tools/techniques	you	learned,	any
changes/adaptations	you	made	to	a	particular	resource	to	make	it	work	with	your	site). <br>
I learned how to correctly proportion all of the content within my site, be it a mobile or desktop variant. At times it was tricky, but all was well in the end as everything came together. <br>
At first I was going to have a mutli-page website, but then I started dabbling with making a full-page website and started to see it as more elegant and more informative than a multi-page site. <br>


What	aspect(s)	of	your	work	do	you	think	worked	well	and	why? <br>
I really like the design of my website, being it a full-page website, all of the content is just there, in one place. <br>
I believe that the images that were included within the websites page complemented the content that can be found on each section, which may be easier for the user to understand what each section is at first glance. <br> <br>

What	aspect(s)	of	your	work	could	be	improved,	and	how	might	you	do	things	differently
another	time? <br>
I believe that the accessibility of my website can be improved in many ways, some being that I should include an alt for all of my images, although most of my images are just background images, so it doesn't ^really^ matter. <br>
Within the navigation bar, I could have included links that when clicked, scroll to that respective part of the webpage, which allows for the user to instantly go somewhere that they would like instead of manually scrolling. <br> <br>
What	resources	were	used	when	creating	your	work? You	should	list	here	any	sources	of
information,	libraries,	plug-ins	or	other	code	that	you	used	to	create	your	site.	You	should
also	reference	any	code	you've	used	by	inserting	comments	at	the	start	of	the	scripts.
